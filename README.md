# Bayesian-Statistics

This repository contains a homework assignment I completed that first involved proving the posterior distributions of the parameters of the Normal distribution and then using a Gibbs Sampler to estimate the mean and variances of groups of chicks.

### Folder Contents:

Code:
Assignment - A PDF of the homework assignment explaining the work to be done
